# Day 1

## Day 1: Arithmetic Operators
### Objective
In this challenge, we practice using arithmetic operators.

### Task

Complete the following functions in the editor below:

1. getArea(length, width): Calculate and return the area of a rectangle having sides _length_ and _width_.
1. getPerimeter(length, width): Calculate and return the perimeter of a rectangle having sides _length_ and _width_. 
   
The values returned by these functions are printed to stdout

## Day 1: Functions
### Objective
Today, we're discussing JavaScript functions.

### Task

Implement a function named factorial that has one parameter: an integer, **_n_**. It must return the value of **_n!_** (i.e., **_n_** factorial).

## Day 1: Let and Const
### Objective
In this challenge, we practice declaring variables using the let and const keywords.

### Task
1. Declare a constant variable, **_PI_**, and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
1. Read a number, **_r_**, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
1. Use **_PI_** and **_r_** to calculate the **_perimeter_** and  of a circle having radius **_r_**.
1. Print **_area_** as the first line of output and print **_perimeter_** as the second line of output.
