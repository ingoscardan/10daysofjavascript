## Day 0: Data Types
###Objective
Review JavaScript's Data types

###Task

Variables named _**firstInteger**_, _**firstDecimal**_, and  are declared for you in the editor below. You must use the **+** operator to perform the following sequence of operations:

1. Convert **_secondInteger_** to an integer (Number type), then sum it with _**firstInteger**_ and print the result on a new line using console.log.
2. Convert **_secondDecimal_** to a floating-point number (Number type), then sum it with _**firstDecimal**_ and print the result on a new line using console.log.
3. Print the concatenation of **_firstString_** and **_secondString_** on a new line using console.log. Note that  must be printed first.
