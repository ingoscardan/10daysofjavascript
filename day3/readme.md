## Day 3: Try, Catch, and Finally
### Objective
In this challenge, we learn about strings and exceptions.

### Task
Complete the reverseString function; it has one parameter, **_s_**. You must perform the following actions:

Try to reverse string  using the split, reverse, and join methods.
1. If an exception is thrown, catch it and print the contents of the exception's **_message_** on a new line.
1. Print **_s_** on a new line. If no exception was thrown, then this should be the reversed string; if an exception was thrown, 
this should be the original string.

## Day 3: Throw
### Objective
In this challenge, we practice using throw and catch statements to work with custom error messages.

### Task
Complete the isPositive function. It has one integer parameter, **_a_**. If the value of **_a_** is positive, 
it must return the string YES. Otherwise, it must throw an Error according to the following rules:

- If **_a_** is **_0_**, throw an Error with **_message_** **_=_** Zero Error.
- If **_a_** is negative, throw an Error with  **_message_** **_=_** Negative Error.
