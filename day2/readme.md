# Day 2

## Day 2: Conditional Statements: If-Else

### Objective
In this challenge, we learn about if-else statements.

### Task
Complete the getGrade(score) function in the editor.
It has one parameter: an integer, **_score_**, denoting the number of points Julia earned on an exam. 
It must return the letter corresponding to her **_grade_** according to the following rules:

Condition | grade
---|---
25 < **_score_** <= 30 | A
20 < **_score_** <= 25 | B
15 < **_score_** <= 20 | C
10 < **_score_** <= 15 | D
5 < **_score_** <= 10 | E
0 <= **_score_** <= 5 | F

## Day 2: Conditional Statements: Switch

### Objective
In this challenge, we learn about switch statements.

### Task
Complete the getLetter(s) function in the editor. It has one parameter: a string, **_s_**, consisting of lowercase 
English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). It must return A, B, C, or D depending on the following criteria:

If the first character in string **_s_** is in the set **_{a, e, i, o, u}_**, then return A.
If the first character in string **_s_** is in the set **_{b, c, d, f, g}_**, then return B.
If the first character in string **_s_** is in the set **_{h, j, k, l, m}_**, then return C.
If the first character in string **_s_** is in the set **_{n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z}_**, then return D.

## Day 2: Loops

### Objective
In this challenge, we practice looping over the characters of string.

### Task
Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function. It has one parameter, a string, **_s_**, consisting of lowercase 
English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). The function must do the following:

1. First, print each vowel in **_s_** on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be 
   printed in the same order as it appeared in **_s_**.
1. Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in **_s_** on a new line in the same order as it appeared in **_s_**.
